- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Interactive functionalities and API integrations.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetching real-time weather data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Weather App on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Web Browser**: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
- **Internet Connection**: Required to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API and load Tailwind CSS from CDN.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**

   - You can simply double-click the `index.html` file.
   - Alternatively, right-click the file and select "Open with" followed by your preferred browser.

### Running the Application

Since this is a static web application, there's no need for a backend server. However, for the best experience and to avoid any CORS issues, it's recommended to use a local development server.

**Using VS Code Live Server Extension**

   - Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code.
   - Open the project folder in VS Code.
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

## Configuration

### OpenWeatherMap API Key

To fetch weather data, the application uses the OpenWeatherMap API. You'll need to obtain an API key and configure it in the project.

1. **Sign Up for OpenWeatherMap**

   - Visit the [OpenWeatherMap Sign Up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) page.
   - Create an account and log in.

2. **Obtain Your API Key**

   - Navigate to the [API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) section in your account.
   - Create a new API key or use the default one provided.

3. **Configure the API Key in the Project**

   - Open the `script.js` file located in the project directory.
   - Locate the following line at the top of the file:

     ```javascript
     const API_KEY = '58fa6abcfa43a0beb00ae355de64323e';
     ```

   - Replace `'58fa6abcfa43a0beb00ae355de64323e'` with your actual API key. For example:

     ```javascript
     const API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key_here';
     ```

   - **Important**: Ensure that your API key is kept secure and not exposed publicly, especially if deploying the application.
